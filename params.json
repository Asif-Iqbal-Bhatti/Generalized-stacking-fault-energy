While the {123} and {112} planes are not exactly identical in \r\nactivation energy to {110}, they are so close in energy that for all intents and \r\npurposes they can be treated as identical. example: \r\nslip plane and direction are (110) and [-111], respectively\r\n```\r\n\r\n**[2] Local-lattice-distortion HEA Alloys**\r\n\r\nAnalysis of atomic mismatch for High Entropy Alloys.
