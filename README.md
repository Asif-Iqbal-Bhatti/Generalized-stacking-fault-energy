# Generalized-stacking-fault-energy

|||--> b means burger vector

|||--> b = a*1/2[111] ;|b| = a*sqrt(3)/2

|||--> On the (110) plane the slip occur at <1-11> 

|||--> For gamma surface vary b form 0b to 1b

NB:: For executation you will need to install atomsk. The link is:
https://github.com/pierrehirel/atomsk/ 
it generates POSCAR files and these can be run independently with VASP and after relaxation in the z direction
the energy can be calulated and GSFE can be calculated and plotted against normalized burger vector.

```
Some bcc materials (e.g. Î±-Fe) can contain up to 48 slip systems. 
There are six slip planes of type {110}, each with two <111> directions (12 systems). 
There are 24 {123} and 12 {112} planes each with one <111> direction (36 systems, 
for a total of 48). While the {123} and {112} planes are not exactly identical in 
activation energy to {110}, they are so close in energy that for all intents and 
purposes they can be treated as identical. example: 
slip plane and direction are (110) and [-111], respectively
